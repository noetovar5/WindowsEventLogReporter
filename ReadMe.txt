Windows Event Log Reporter

This application allows you to quickly view and export Windows Event Logs into a readable HTML report.
It was designed to simplify log analysis for system administrators and technicians by giving quick access
to critical, error, and warning logs directly from a simple interface.

How it works:
1. Open the application.
2. Select the log type (Application or System).
3. Choose the log level (Critical, Error, or Warning).
4. Pick a time range (Anytime, Last Hour, Last 24 Hours, or Last 7 Days).
5. Click 'Print' to generate an HTML report containing all matching logs.

The generated report will be saved in the same folder as the application. Each section in the report
is organized and color-coded by severity, making it easy to identify important events. The footer
includes your application credit and a direct link to your website.
